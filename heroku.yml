# These are four top-level sections available for configuration: setup, build, release and run
# The main function of setup is to specify which add-ons are needed.
# The build section is how we specify the Dockerfile should be, well, built.
# The release phase is used to run tasks before each new release is deployed.
# For example we can make sure collectstatic is run on every deploy automatically.
# At the run phase we specify which processes actually run th application. Notably, the use of Gunicorn as the web server.
